# Step 5: API Documentation with SpringDoc OpenAPI

In this step, we enhance our Spring Boot application by integrating SpringDoc OpenAPI. This library automatically generates API documentation for our REST controllers, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with our backend services.

This integration provides a user-friendly Swagger UI interface that allows developers to explore and test the API endpoints directly from their web browser.


### ✅ What Was Added in This Step
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI**: A library that generates OpenAPI documentation for Spring Boot applications.
- **Swagger UI**: An interactive interface for exploring and testing the API endpoints.
- **Auto-generated Documentation**: The documentation is generated based on the annotations in your REST controllers, models, and validation constraints.
- **Dependency Management**: The necessary dependencies were added to the `pom.xml` file to enable SpringDoc OpenAPI functionality.
- **Configuration**: Basic configuration to set up the API documentation path and Swagger UI path.

### 🌐 How to View the API Documentation
To view the API documentation generated by SpringDoc OpenAPI, follow these steps:

1.	Start the Application

``` bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

2.	Access the Swagger UI

Visit:

```plaintext
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

This page displays a visual, interactive API reference based on your REST controllers.

### 📌 Example Features of the Swagger UI
- Lists all REST endpoints
-	Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
-	Allows trying out endpoints directly from the browser
-	Automatically reflects model validation constraints (like required fields)

### ⚙️ Configuration Notes

If needed, you can customize Swagger metadata like title, version, and description via application.properties:
``` properties
springdoc.api-docs.enabled=true
springdoc.api-docs.path=/v3/api-docs
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```
